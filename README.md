## Holy Quran

To be able to read quran in your smartphone:

- Download quran.epub file from the project files or [releases page](https://github.com/rockneverdies55/quran-epub/releases)

- In android, have Google "Play Books" (if not installed by default) application installed or any other epub supporting reading app.

- On IOS, you can install iBooks application (if not installed by default) or any other epub supporting reading app from the app store.

If you have an e-Reader device such as Kindle, you can also read quran on your eReader.

#### Features

- Adjust font to your liking for ease of reading
- You can open any chapter (surah) using table of contents
- Or, go to any juz directly
- Depending on reading medium; dictionary support when long pressed on any word (tested on my kindle and play-books app on my android)

To add quran to your kindle library:
- https://www.amazon.com/gp/sendtokindle


To add quran to your google play books library:
- https://play.google.com/books/uploads
- 

For apple, I guess the quran.epub should be uploaded to iCloud and books feature needs to be enabled to see the Book in your iBooks library. Guidance from ios/apple users would be appreciated.
